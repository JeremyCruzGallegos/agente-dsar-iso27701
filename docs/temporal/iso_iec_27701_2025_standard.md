## Introduction

### 0.1 General

Almost every organization processes personally identifiable information (PII). Further, the quantity and types of PII processed are increasing, as are the number of situations where an organization needs to cooperate with other organizations regarding the processing of PII. Protection of privacy in the context of the processing of PII is a societal need, as well as the topic of dedicated legal requirements worldwide.

This document includes mapping to:
- the privacy framework and principles defined in ISO/IEC 29100;
- ISO/IEC 27018;
- ISO/IEC 29151;
- the EU General Data Protection Regulation.

> **NOTE:** These mappings can be interpreted to take into account local legal requirements.

This document can be used by PII controllers (including those that are joint PII controllers) and PII processors (including those using subcontracted PII processors and those processing PII as subcontractors to PII processors).

By complying with the requirements in this document, an organization can generate evidence of how it handles the processing of PII. Such evidence can be used to facilitate agreements with business partners where the processing of PII is mutually relevant. This can also assist in relationships with other interested parties. The use of this document can provide independent verification of this evidence.

### 0.2 Compatibility with other management system standards

This document applies the framework developed by ISO to improve alignment among its management system standards.

This document enables an organization to align or integrate its privacy information management system (PIMS) with the requirements of other management system standards, and in particular with the information security management system specified in ISO/IEC 27001.

---

## 1 Scope

## 4 Context of the organization

### 4.1 Understanding the organization and its context

The organization shall determine external and internal issues that are relevant to its purpose and that affect its ability to achieve the intended result(s) of its privacy information management system.

The organization shall determine whether climate change is a relevant issue.

The organization shall determine if it is acting as a PII controller (including as a joint PII controller) or as a PII processor.

The organization shall determine external and internal issues that are relevant to its context and that affect its ability to achieve the intended outcome(s) of its PIMS.

> **NOTE 1:** External and internal issues can include but are not limited to:
> - applicable privacy legislation;
> - applicable regulations;
> - applicable judicial decisions;
> - applicable organizational context, governance, policies and procedures;
> - applicable administrative decisions;
> - applicable contractual requirements.

Where the organization acts in both roles (i.e. a PII controller and a PII processor), separate roles shall be determined, each of which is the subject of a separate set of controls.

> **NOTE 2:** The role of the organization can be different for each instance of the processing of PII, since it depends on who determines the purposes and means of the processing.

### 4.2 Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties

The organization shall determine:
- the interested parties that are relevant to the privacy information management system;
- the relevant requirements of these interested parties;
- which of these requirements will be addressed through the privacy information management system.

> **NOTE 1:** Relevant interested parties can have requirements related to climate change.

The organization shall include among its interested parties those parties having interests or responsibilities associated with the processing of PII, including the PII principals.

> **NOTE 2:** Other interested parties can include customers, supervisory authorities, other PII controllers, PII processors and their subcontractors.

Depending on the role of the organization, "customer" can be understood as either:
- **a)** an organization who has a contract with a PII controller (e.g. the customer of the PII controller);
  > **NOTE 3:** This can be the case of an organization which is a joint PII controller.
- **b)** a PII controller who has a contract with a PII processor (e.g. the customer of the PII processor); or
- **c)** a PII processor who has a contract with a subcontractor for PII processing (e.g. the customer of the subcontracted PII processor).

> **NOTE 4:** An individual person whose PII is processed in a business association (for example in a consumer, employee, vendor, visitor relationship) is referred to as a "PII principal" in this document.  
> **NOTE 5:** Requirements relevant to the processing of PII can be determined by legal and regulatory requirements, by contractual obligations and by self-imposed organizational objectives. The privacy principles set out in ISO/IEC 29100 provide guidance concerning the processing of PII.  
> **NOTE 6:** To demonstrate conformity with the organization's obligations, some interested parties can expect that the organization is in conformity with specific standards, such as the management system specified in this document or any relevant set of specifications. These parties can call for independently audited conformity to these standards.

### 4.3 Determining the scope of the privacy information management system

The organization shall determine the boundaries and applicability of the privacy information management system to establish its scope.

When determining this scope, the organization shall consider:
- the external and internal issues referred to in 4.1;

## Annex B (normative)
### Implementation guidance for PII controllers and PII processors

### B.1 Implementation guidance for PII controllers

#### B.1.1 General
This clause provides PIMS guidance for PII controllers, which relates to the controls listed in Table A.1.

#### B.1.2 Conditions for collection and processing

##### B.1.2.1 Objective
To demonstrate that processing is lawful, with legal basis as per applicable jurisdictions, and with clearly defined and legitimate purposes.

##### B.1.2.2 Identify and document purpose
**Control**  
The organization should identify and document the specific purposes for which the PII will be processed.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should ensure that PII principals understand the purpose for which their PII is processed. It is the responsibility of the organization to clearly document and communicate this to PII principals. Without a clear statement of the purpose for processing, consent and choice cannot be adequately given.

Documentation of the purpose(s) for processing PII should be sufficiently clear and detailed so that it can be used as part of the information to be provided to PII principals (see B.1.3.3). This documentation should include information necessary to obtain consent (see B.1.2.4), as well as documented information of policies and procedures (see B.1.2.9).

**Other information**  
In the deployment of cloud computing services, the taxonomy and definitions in ISO/IEC 19944-1 can be helpful in providing terms for describing the purpose of the processing of PII.

##### B.1.2.3 Identify lawful basis
**Control**  
The organization should determine, document and be able to demonstrate compliance with the relevant lawful basis for the processing of PII for the identified purposes.

**Implementation guidance**  
Some jurisdictions require the organization to be able to demonstrate that the lawfulness of processing was duly established before the processing.

The legal basis for the processing of PII can include:
- consent from PII principals;
- performance of a contract;
- compliance with a legal obligation;
- protection of the vital interests of PII principals;
- performance of a task carried out in the public interest;
- legitimate interests of the PII controller.

The organization should document this basis for each PII processing activity (see B.1.2.9).

The legitimate interests of the organization can include, for instance, information security objectives, which should be balanced against the obligations to PII principals with regards to the protection of privacy.

Whenever special categories of PII are defined, either by the nature of the PII (e.g. health information) or by the PII principals concerned (e.g. PII relating to children) the organization should include those categories of PII in its classification schemes.

The classification of PII that falls into these categories can vary from one jurisdiction to another and can vary between different regulatory regimes that apply to different kinds of business, so the organization should be aware of the classification(s) that apply to the PII processing being performed.

The use of special categories of PII can also be subject to more stringent controls.

Changing or extending the purposes for the processing of PII can require updating or revision of the legal basis. It can also require additional consent to be obtained from the PII principal.

##### B.1.2.4 Determine when and how consent is to be obtained
**Control**  
The organization should determine and document a process by which it can demonstrate if, when and how consent for the processing of PII was obtained from PII principals.

**Implementation guidance**  
Consent can be required for processing of PII. The organization should clearly document when consent needs to be obtained and the requirements for obtaining consent. It can be useful to correlate the purpose(s) for processing with information about if and how consent is obtained.

> **NOTE:** Legal requirements can apply.

Some jurisdictions have specific requirements for how consent is collected and recorded (e.g. not bundled with other agreements). Additionally, certain types of data collection (e.g. for scientific research) and certain types of PII principals, such as children, can be subject to additional requirements. The organization should take into account such requirements and document how mechanisms for consent meet those requirements.

##### B.1.2.5 Obtain and record consent
**Control**  
The organization should obtain and record consent from PII principals according to the documented processes.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should obtain and record consent from PII principals in such a way that it can provide details by request of the consent provided (e.g. the time that consent was provided, the identification of the PII principal and the consent statement).

The information delivered to the PII principal before the consent process should follow the guidance in B.1.3.4.

The consent should be:
- freely given;
- specific regarding the purpose for processing; and
- unambiguous and explicit.

##### B.1.2.6 Privacy impact assessment
**Control**  
The organization should assess the need for, and implement where appropriate, a privacy impact assessment whenever new processing of PII or changes to existing processing of PII is planned.

**Implementation guidance**  
PII processing generates risks for PII principals. These risks should be assessed through a privacy impact assessment. Some jurisdictions define cases for which a privacy impact assessment is mandated. Criteria can include automated decision making which produces legal effects on PII principals, large scale processing of special categories of PII (e.g. health-related information, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, genetic data or biometric data), or systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.

The organization should determine the elements that are necessary for the completion of a privacy impact assessment. These can include a list of the types of PII processed, where the PII is stored and where it can be transferred. Data flow diagrams and data maps can also be helpful in this context.

> **NOTE:** See B.1.2.9 for details of documented information of the processing of PII that can inform a privacy impact or other risk assessment.

**Other information**  
Guidance on privacy impact assessments related to the processing of PII can be found in ISO/IEC 29134.

##### B.1.2.7 Contracts with PII processors
**Control**  
The organization should have a written contract with any PII processor that it uses and should ensure that its contracts with PII processors address the implementation of the appropriate controls in Table A.2.

**Implementation guidance**  
The contract between the organization and any PII processor processing PII on its behalf should require the PII processor to implement the appropriate controls specified in Table A.2, taking account of the information security risk assessment process (see 6.1.2) and the scope of the processing of PII performed by the PII processor. By default, all controls specified in Table A.2 should be assumed as relevant. If the organization decides that the PII processor is not required to implement a control from Table A.2, it should justify its exclusion (see 6.1.3).

A contract can define the responsibilities of each party differently but, to be consistent with this document, all controls should be considered and included in the documented information.

##### B.1.2.8 Joint PII controller
**Control**  
The organization should determine respective roles and responsibilities for the processing of PII (including PII protection and security requirements) with any joint PII controller.

**Implementation guidance**  
Roles and responsibilities for the processing of PII should be determined in a transparent manner.

These roles and responsibilities should be documented in a contract or any similar binding document that contains the terms and conditions for the joint processing of PII. In some jurisdictions, such an agreement is called a data sharing agreement.

A joint PII controller agreement can include:
- the purpose of PII sharing/joint PII controller relationship;
- the identity of the organizations (PII controllers) that are part of the joint PII controller relationship;
- the categories of PII to be shared or transferred and processed under the agreement;
- an overview of the processing operations (e.g. transfer, use);
- a description of the respective roles and responsibilities;
- the responsibility for implementing technical and organizational security measures for PII protection;
- the definition of responsibility in case of a PII breach (e.g. who will notify, when, mutual information);
- terms of retention or disposal of PII;
- liabilities for failure to comply with the agreement;
- how obligations to PII principals are met;
- how to provide PII principals with information covering the essence of the arrangement between the joint PII controllers;
- how PII principals can obtain other information they are entitled to receive; and
- a contact point for PII principals.

##### B.1.2.9 Records related to processing PII
**Control**  
The organization should determine and securely maintain the necessary records in support of its obligations for the processing of PII.

**Implementation guidance**  
Documented information of the processing of PII can be maintained through an inventory or list of the PII processing activities that the organization performs. Such an inventory can include:
- the type of processing;
- the purposes for the processing;
- a description of the categories of PII and PII principals (e.g. children);
- the categories of recipients to whom PII has been or will be disclosed, including recipients in third countries or international organizations;
- a general description of the technical and organizational security measures; and
- a privacy impact assessment report.

Such an inventory should have an owner who is responsible for its accuracy and completeness.

#### B.1.3 Obligations to PII principals

##### B.1.3.1 Objective
To ensure that PII principals are provided with appropriate information about the processing of their PII, and to meet any other applicable obligations to PII principals related to the processing of their PII.

##### B.1.3.2 Determining and fulfilling obligations to PII principals
**Control**  
The organization should determine and document its legal, regulatory and business obligations to PII principals related to the processing of their PII and provide the means to meet these obligations.

**Implementation guidance**  
Obligations to PII principals and the means to support them vary from one jurisdiction to another.

The organization should ensure that they provide the appropriate means to meet the obligations to PII principals in an accessible and timely manner. Clear documentation should be provided to the PII principal describing the extent to which the obligations to them are fulfilled and how, along with an up-to-date contact point where they can address their requests.

The contact point should be provided in a similar way to that used to collect PII and consent (e.g. if PII are collected by email or a website, the contact point should be by email or the website, not an alternative such as phone or fax).

##### B.1.3.3 Determining information for PII principals
**Control**  
The organization should determine and document the information to be provided to PII principals regarding the processing of their PII and the timing of such a provision.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should determine the legal, regulatory or business requirements for providing information to the PII principal (e.g. prior to processing, within a certain time from when it is requested) and for the type of information to be provided.

Depending on the requirements, this information can take the form of a notice. Examples of types of information that can be provided to PII principals are:
- information about the purpose of the processing (see B.1.2.2);
- contact details for the PII controller or its representative;
- information about the lawful basis for the processing (see B.1.2.3);
- information on where the PII was obtained, if not obtained directly from the PII principal;
- information about whether the provision of PII is a statutory or contractual requirement, and where appropriate, the possible consequences of failure to provide PII;
- information on obligations to PII principals, as determined in B.1.3.2, and how PII principals can benefit from them, especially regarding accessing, amending, correcting, requesting erasure, receiving a copy of their PII and objecting to the processing;
- information on how the PII principal can withdraw consent (see B.1.3.5);
- information about transfers of PII;
- information about recipients or categories of recipients of PII;
- information about the period for which the PII will be retained;
- information about the use of automated decision making based on the automated processing of PII;
- information about the right to lodge a complaint and how to lodge such a complaint;
- information regarding the frequency with which information is provided (e.g. "just in time" notification, organization defined frequency).

The organization should provide updated information if the purposes for the processing of PII are changed or extended.

##### B.1.3.4 Providing information to PII principals
**Control**  
The organization should provide PII principals with clear and easily accessible information identifying the PII controller and describing the processing of their PII.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should provide the information detailed in B.1.3.3 to PII principals in a timely, concise, complete, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, as appropriate to the target audience.

Where appropriate, the information should be given at the time of PII collection. It should also be permanently accessible.

> **NOTE:** Icons and images can be helpful to the PII principal by giving a visual overview of the intended processing.

##### B.1.3.5 Providing mechanism to modify or withdraw consent
**Control**  
The organization should provide a mechanism for PII principals to modify or withdraw their consent.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should inform PII principals of their rights related to withdrawing consent (which can vary by jurisdiction) at any time and provide the mechanism to do so. The mechanism used for withdrawal depends on the system; it should be consistent with the mechanisms used for obtaining consent when possible. For example, if the consent is collected by email or a website, the mechanism for withdrawing it should be the same, not an alternative solution such as phone or fax.

Modifying consent can include placing restrictions on the processing of PII, which can include restricting the PII controller from deleting the PII in some cases.

Some jurisdictions impose restrictions on when and how a PII principal can modify or withdraw their consent.

The organization should record any request to withdraw or change consent in a similar way to the recording of the consent itself.

Any change of consent should be disseminated, through appropriate systems, to authorized users and to relevant third parties.

The organization should define a response time and requests should be handled according to it.

**Additional information**  
When consent for processing of specific PII is withdrawn, all the processing of PII performed before withdrawal should normally be considered as appropriate, but the results of such processing should not be used for new processing. For example, if a PII principal withdraws their consent for profiling, their profile should not be further used or consulted.

##### B.1.3.6 Providing mechanism to object to PII processing
**Control**  
The organization should provide a mechanism for PII principals to object to the processing of their PII.

**Implementation guidance**  
Some jurisdictions provide PII principals with a right to object to the processing of their PII. Organizations subject to the legal requirements of such jurisdictions should be able to demonstrate how they ensure that they retain records of PII principals exercising this right.

The organization should document the legal and regulatory requirements related to objections by the PII principals to processing (e.g. objection relating to the processing of PII for direct marketing purposes). The organization should provide information to principals regarding the ability to object in these situations.

Mechanisms to object can vary but should be consistent with the type of service provided (e.g. online services should provide this capability online).

##### B.1.3.7 Access, correction or erasure
**Control**  
The organization should implement policies, procedures or mechanisms to meet its obligations to PII principals to access, correct or erase their PII.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should implement policies, procedures or mechanisms for enabling PII principals to obtain access to, correct and erase their PII, if requested and without undue delay.

The organization should define a response time and requests should be handled according to it.

Any corrections or erasures should be disseminated through the system or to authorized users, and should be passed to third parties (see B.1.3.8) to whom the PII has been transferred.

> **NOTE:** Documented information generated by the control specified in B.1.5.4 can help in this regard.

The organization should implement policies, procedures or mechanisms for use when there can be a dispute about the accuracy or correction of the data by the PII principal. These policies, procedures or mechanisms should include informing the PII principal of what changes were made, and of reasons why corrections cannot be made (where this is the case).

Some jurisdictions impose restrictions on when and how a PII principal can request correction or erasure of their PII. The organization should keep abreast of such restrictions.

##### B.1.3.8 PII controllers' obligations to inform third parties
**Control**  
The organization should inform third parties with whom PII has been shared of any modification, withdrawal or objections pertaining to the shared PII, and implement appropriate policies, procedures or mechanisms to do so.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should take appropriate steps, bearing in mind the available technology, to inform third parties of any modification or withdrawal of consent, or objections pertaining to the shared PII.

The organization should determine and maintain active communication channels with third parties. Related responsibilities can be assigned to individuals in charge of their operations and maintenance. When informing third parties, the organization should monitor its acknowledgement of receipt of the information.

> **NOTE:** Changes resulting from the obligations to PII principals can include modification or withdrawal of consent, requests for correction, erasure, or restrictions on processing, or objections to the processing of PII as requested by the PII principal.

##### B.1.3.9 Providing copy of PII processed
**Control**  
The organization should be able to provide a copy of the PII that is processed when requested by the PII principal.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should provide a copy of the PII that is processed in a structured, commonly used, format accessible by the PII principal.

Some jurisdictions define cases where the organization should provide a copy of the PII processed in a format allowing portability to the PII principals or to recipient PII controllers (typically structured, commonly used and machine readable).

The organization should ensure that any copies of PII provided to a PII principal relate specifically to that PII principal.

Where the requested PII has already been deleted subject to the retention and disposal policy (as described in B.1.4.8), the PII controller should inform the PII principal that the requested PII has been deleted.

In cases where the organization is no longer able to identify the PII principal (e.g. as a result of a de-identification process), the organization should not seek to (re-)identify the PII principals for the sole reason of implementing this control. However, in some jurisdictions, legitimate requests can require that additional information is requested from the PII principal to enable re-identification and subsequent disclosure.

Where technically feasible, it should be possible to transfer a copy of the PII from one organization directly to another organization, at the request of the PII principal.

##### B.1.3.10 Handling requests
**Control**  
The organization should define and document policies and procedures for handling and responding to legitimate requests from PII principals.

**Implementation guidance**  
Legitimate requests can include requests for a copy of PII processed, or requests to lodge a complaint.

Some jurisdictions allow the organization to charge a fee in certain cases (e.g. excessive or repetitive requests).

Requests should be handled within the appropriate defined response times.

Some jurisdictions define response times, depending on the complexity and number of the requests, as well as requirements to inform PII principals of any delay. The appropriate response times should be defined in the privacy policy.

##### B.1.3.11 Automated decision making
**Control**  
The organization should identify obligations, including legal obligations, to the PII principals resulting from decisions made by the organization which are related to the PII principal based solely on automated processing of PII, and be able to demonstrate how it addresses these obligations.

**Implementation guidance**  
Some jurisdictions define specific obligations to PII principals when a decision based solely on automated processing of PII significantly affects them, such as notifying the existence of automated decision making, allowing for the PII principals to object to such decision making, or obtaining human intervention.

> **NOTE:** In some jurisdictions, some processing of PII cannot be fully automated.

Organizations operating in these jurisdictions should be able to demonstrate how they take compliance with these obligations into account.

#### B.1.4 Privacy by design and privacy by default

##### B.1.4.1 Objective
To ensure that processes and systems are designed such that the collection and processing of PII (including use, disclosure, retention, transmission and disposal) are limited to what is necessary for the identified purpose.

##### B.1.4.2 Limit collection
**Control**  
The organization should limit the collection of PII to the minimum that is relevant, proportional and necessary for the identified purposes.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should limit the collection of PII to what is adequate, relevant and necessary in relation to the identified purposes. This includes limiting the amount of PII that the organization collects indirectly (e.g. through web logs, system logs).

Privacy by default implies that, where any optionality in the collection and processing of PII exists, each option should be disabled by default and only enabled by explicit choice of the PII principal.

##### B.1.4.3 Limit processing
**Control**  
The organization should limit the processing of PII to that which is adequate, relevant and necessary for the identified purposes.

**Implementation guidance**  
Limiting the processing of PII should be managed through information security and privacy policies (see 5.2) along with documented procedures for their adoption and compliance.

Processing of PII should be limited by default to the minimum necessary, relative to the identified purposes. This processing includes:
- the disclosure;
- the period of PII storage; and
- who can access their PII.

##### B.1.4.4 Accuracy and quality
**Control**  
The organization should ensure and document that PII is as accurate, complete and up to date as necessary for the purposes for which it is processed, throughout the life cycle of the PII.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should implement policies, procedures or mechanisms to minimize inaccuracies in the PII it processes. There should also be policies, procedures or mechanisms to respond to instances of inaccurate PII. These policies, procedures or mechanisms should be included in the documented information (e.g. through technical system configurations) and should apply throughout the PII life cycle.

**Additional information**  
For further information on the PII processing life cycle, see ISO/IEC 29101:2018, 6.2.

##### B.1.4.5 PII minimization objectives
**Control**  
The organization should define and document data minimization objectives and what mechanisms (such as de-identification) are used to meet those objectives.

**Implementation guidance**  
Organizations should identify how the specific PII and amount of PII collected and processed is limited relative to the identified purposes. This can include the use of de-identification or other data minimization techniques.

The identified purpose (see B.1.2.2) can require the processing of PII that has not been de-identified, in which case the organization should be able to describe such processing.

In other cases, the identified purpose does not require the processing of the original PII, and the processing of PII which has been de-identified can suffice to achieve the identified purpose. In these cases, the organization should define and document the extent to which the PII should be associated with the PII principal, as well as the mechanisms and techniques designed to process PII, such that the de-identification and PII minimization objectives are achieved.

Mechanisms used to minimize PII vary depending on the type of processing and the systems used for the processing. The organization should document any mechanisms (e.g. technical system configurations) used to implement data minimization.

In cases where processing of de-identified data is sufficient for the purposes, the organization should document any mechanisms (e.g. technical system configurations) designed to implement de-identification objectives set by the organization in a timely manner. For instance, the removal of attributes associated with PII principals can be sufficient to allow the organization to achieve its identified purpose. In other cases, other de-identification techniques, such as generalization (e.g. rounding) or randomization techniques (e.g. noise addition) can be used to achieve an adequate level of de-identification.

> **NOTE 1:** For further information on de-identification techniques, refer to ISO/IEC 20889.  
> **NOTE 2:** For cloud computing, ISO/IEC 19944-1 provides a definition of data identification qualifiers that can be used to classify the degree to which the data can identify a PII principal or associate a PII principal with a set of characteristics in the PII.

##### B.1.4.6 PII de-identification and deletion at the end of processing
**Control**  
The organization should either delete PII or render it in a form which does not permit identification or re-identification of PII principals, as soon as the original PII is no longer necessary for the identified purpose(s).

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should have mechanisms to erase the PII when no further processing is anticipated. Alternatively, some de-identification techniques can be used, as long as the resulting de-identified data cannot reasonably permit re-identification of PII principals.

##### B.1.4.7 Temporary files
**Control**  
The organization should ensure that temporary files created as a result of the processing of PII are disposed of (e.g. erased or destroyed) following documented procedures within a specified, documented period.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should perform periodic checks that unused temporary files are deleted within the identified time period.

**Other information**  
Information systems can create temporary files in the normal course of their operation. Such files are specific to the system or application but can include file system roll-back journals and temporary files associated with the updating of databases and the operation of other application software. Temporary files are not needed after the related information processing task has been completed but there are circumstances in which they cannot be deleted. The length of time for which these files remain in use is not always deterministic but a "garbage collection" procedure should identify the relevant files and determine how long it has been since they were last used.

##### B.1.4.8 Retention
**Control**  
The organization should not retain PII for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the PII is processed.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should develop and maintain retention schedules for information it retains, taking into account the requirement to retain PII for no longer than is necessary. Such schedules should take into account legal, regulatory and business requirements. Where such requirements conflict, a business decision should be taken (based on a risk assessment) and documented in the appropriate schedule.

##### B.1.4.9 Disposal
**Control**  
The organization should have documented policies, procedures or mechanisms for the disposal of PII.

**Implementation guidance**  
The choice of PII disposal techniques depends on a number of factors, as disposal techniques differ in their properties and outcomes (e.g. in the granularity of the resultant physical media, or the ability to recover deleted information on electronic media). Factors to consider when choosing an appropriate disposal technique include, but are not limited to, the nature and extent of the PII to be disposed of, whether or not there is metadata associated with the PII, and the physical characteristics of the media on which the PII is stored.

##### B.1.4.10 PII transmission controls
**Control**  
The organization should subject PII that has been transmitted (e.g. sent to another organization) over a data-transmission network to the appropriate controls designed to ensure that the data reaches its intended destination.

**Implementation guidance**  
Transmission of PII should be controlled, typically by ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to transmission systems, and by following the appropriate processes (including the retention of audit logs) to ensure that PII is transmitted without compromise to the correct recipients.

#### B.1.5 PII sharing, transfer and disclosure

##### B.1.5.1 Objective
To determine whether, and document when, PII is shared, transferred to other jurisdictions or third parties, or disclosed according to applicable obligations.

##### B.1.5.2 Identify basis for PII transfer between jurisdictions
**Control**  
The organization should identify and document the relevant basis for transfers of PII between jurisdictions.

**Implementation guidance**  
PII transfer can be subject to legal requirements, depending on the jurisdiction or international organization to which data are to be transferred (and from where the data originate). The organization should document compliance to such requirements as the basis for transfer.

Some jurisdictions can require that information transfer agreements be reviewed by a designated supervisory authority. Organizations operating in such jurisdictions should be aware of any such requirements.

> **NOTE:** Where transfers take place within a specific jurisdiction, the applicable legal requirements are the same for the sender and recipient.

##### B.1.5.3 Countries and international organizations to which PII can be transferred
**Control**  
The organization should specify and document the countries and international organizations to which PII can possibly be transferred.

**Implementation guidance**  
The identities of the countries and international organizations to which PII can possibly be transferred in normal operations should be made available to customers. The identities of the countries arising from the use of subcontracted PII processing should be included. The countries included should be considered in relation to B.1.5.2.

Outside of normal operations, there can be cases of transfer made at the request of a legal authority, for which the identity of the countries cannot be specified in advance, or such transfer can be prohibited by applicable jurisdictions to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation (see B.1.5.2, B.2.5.5 and B.2.5.6).

##### B.1.5.4 Records of transfer of PII
**Control**  
The organization should record transfers of PII to or from third parties and ensure cooperation with those parties to support future requests related to obligations to the PII principals.

**Implementation guidance**  
Recording can include transfers from third parties of PII which has been modified as a result of PII controllers' managing its obligations, or transfers to third parties to implement legitimate requests from PII principals, including requests to erase PII (e.g. after consent withdrawal).

The organization should have a policy defining the retention period of these records.

The organization should apply the data minimization principle to the records of transfers by retaining only the strictly needed information.

##### B.1.5.5 Records of PII disclosure to third parties
**Control**  
The organization should record disclosures of PII to third parties, including which PII has been disclosed, to whom and at what time.

**Implementation guidance**  
PII can be disclosed during normal operations. These disclosures should be recorded. Any additional disclosures to third parties, such as those arising from legal investigations or external audits, should also be recorded. The records should include the source of the disclosure and the source of the authority to make the disclosure.

---

### B.2 Implementation guidance for PII processors

#### B.2.1 General
This clause provides PIMS guidance for PII processors, which relates to the controls listed in Table A.2.

#### B.2.2 Conditions for collection and processing

##### B.2.2.1 Objective
To demonstrate that processing is lawful, with legal basis as per applicable jurisdictions, and with clearly defined and legitimate purposes.

##### B.2.2.2 Customer agreement
**Control**  
The organization should ensure, where relevant, that the contract to process PII addresses the organization's role in providing assistance with the customer's obligations (taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the organization).

**Implementation guidance**  
The contract between the organization and the customer should include the following aspects, where relevant and depending on the customer's role (i.e. PII controller or PII processor):
- privacy by design and privacy by default (see B.1.4 and B.2.4);
- achieving security of processing;
- notification of breaches involving PII to a supervisory authority;
- notification of breaches involving PII to customers and PII principals;
- conducting privacy impact assessments; and
- the assurance of assistance by the PII processor if prior consultations with relevant PII protection authorities are needed.

Some jurisdictions require that the contract includes the subject matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of PII and categories of PII principals.

##### B.2.2.3 Organization's purposes
**Control**  
The organization should ensure that PII processed on behalf of a customer are only processed for the purposes expressed in the documented instructions of the customer.

**Implementation guidance**  
The contract between the organization and the customer should include, but not be limited to, the objective and time frame to be achieved by the service.

In order to achieve the customer's purpose, there can be technical reasons why it is appropriate for the organization to determine the method for processing PII, consistent with the general instructions of the customer but without the customer's express instruction. For example, in order to efficiently utilize network or processing capacity, it can be necessary to allocate specific processing resources depending on certain characteristics of the PII principal.

The organization should allow the customer to verify its compliance with the purpose specification and limitation principles. This also ensures that no PII is processed by the organization or any of its subcontractors for other purposes than those expressed in the documented instructions of the customer.

##### B.2.2.4 Marketing and advertising use
**Control**  
The organization should not use PII processed under a contract for the purposes of marketing and advertising without establishing that prior consent was obtained from the appropriate PII principal. The organization should not make providing such consent a condition for receiving the service.

**Implementation guidance**  
Compliance of PII processors with the customer's contractual requirements should be documented, especially where marketing or advertising is planned.

Organizations should not insist on the inclusion of marketing or advertising uses where express consent has not been fairly obtained from PII principals.

> **NOTE:** This control complements the more general control in B.2.2.3 and does not replace or otherwise supersede it.

##### B.2.2.5 Infringing instruction
**Control**  
The organization should inform the customer if, in its opinion, a processing instruction infringes applicable legal requirements.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization's ability to verify if the instruction infringes legal requirements can depend on the technological context, on the instruction itself, and on the contract between the organization and the customer.

##### B.2.2.6 Customer obligations
**Control**  
The organization should provide the customer with the appropriate information such that the customer can demonstrate compliance with their obligations.

**Implementation guidance**  
The information needed by the customer can include whether the organization allows for and contributes to audits conducted by the customer or another auditor mandated or otherwise agreed by the customer.

##### B.2.2.7 Records related to processing PII
**Control**  
The organization should determine and maintain the necessary records in support of demonstrating compliance with its obligations (as specified in the applicable contract) for the processing of PII carried out on behalf of a customer.

**Implementation guidance**  
Some jurisdictions can require the organization to record information such as:
- categories of processing carried out on behalf of each customer;
- transfers to third countries or international organizations; and
- a general description of the technical and organizational security measures.

#### B.2.3 Obligations to PII principals

##### B.2.3.1 Objective
To ensure that PII principals are provided with the appropriate information about the processing of their PII, and to meet any other applicable obligations to PII principals related to the processing of their PII.

##### B.2.3.2 Comply with obligations to PII principals
**Control**  
The organization should provide the customer with the means to comply with its obligations related to PII principals.

**Implementation guidance**  
A PII controller's obligations can be defined by legal requirements or by contract. These obligations can include matters where the customer uses the services of the organization for implementation of these obligations. For example, this can include the correction or deletion of PII in a timely fashion.

Where a customer depends on the organization for information or technical measures to facilitate meeting the obligations to PII principals, the relevant information or technical measures should be specified in a contract.

#### B.2.4 Privacy by design and privacy by default

##### B.2.4.1 Objective
To ensure that processes and systems are designed such that the collection and processing of PII (including use, disclosure, retention, transmission and disposal) are limited to what is necessary for the identified purpose.

##### B.2.4.2 Temporary files
**Control**  
The organization should ensure that temporary files created as a result of the processing of PII are disposed of (e.g. erased or destroyed) following documented procedures within a specified, documented period.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should conduct periodic verification that unused temporary files are deleted within the identified time period.

**Other information**  
Information systems can create temporary files in the normal course of their operation. Such files are specific to the system or application but can include file system roll-back journals and temporary files associated with the updating of databases and the operation of other application software. Temporary files are not needed after the related information processing task has been completed but there are circumstances in which they cannot be deleted. The length of time for which these files remain in use is not always deterministic but a "garbage collection" procedure should identify the relevant files and determine how long it has been since they were last used.

##### B.2.4.3 Return, transfer or disposal of PII
**Control**  
The organization should be able to return, transfer or dispose of PII in a secure manner. It should also make its policy available to the customer.

**Implementation guidance**  
At some point in time, it can be necessary to dispose of PII in some manner. This can involve returning the PII to the customer, transferring it to another organization or to a PII controller (e.g. as a result of a merger), deleting or otherwise destroying it, de-identifying it or archiving it. The capability for the return, transfer or disposal of PII should be managed in a secure manner.

The organization should provide the assurance necessary to allow the customer to ensure that PII processed under a contract is erased (by the organization and any of its subcontractors) from wherever they are stored, including for the purposes of backup and business continuity, as soon as they are no longer necessary for the purposes identified by the customer.

The organization should develop and implement a policy in respect to the disposal of PII and should make this policy available to customers when requested.

The policy should cover the retention period for PII before its disposal after termination of a contract, to protect the customer from losing PII through an accidental lapse of the contract.

> **NOTE:** This control and guidance is also relevant under the retention principle (see B.1.4.8).

##### B.2.4.4 PII transmission controls
**Control**  
The organization should subject PII transmitted over a data-transmission network to appropriate controls, which are designed to ensure that the data reaches its intended destination.

**Implementation guidance**  
Transmission of PII should be controlled, typically by ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to transmission systems, and by following the appropriate processes (including the retention of audit data) to ensure that PII is transmitted without compromise to the correct recipients. Requirements for transmission controls can be included in the contract between the PII processor and the customer.

Where no contractual requirements related to transmission are in place, it can be appropriate to take advice from the customer prior to transmission.

#### B.2.5 PII sharing, transfer and disclosure

##### B.2.5.1 Objective
To determine whether, and document when, PII is shared, transferred to other jurisdictions or third parties, or disclosed according to applicable obligations.

##### B.2.5.2 Basis for PII transfer between jurisdictions
**Control**  
The organization should inform the customer in a timely manner of the basis for PII transfers between jurisdictions and of any intended changes in this regard, so that the customer can object to such changes or terminate the contract.

**Implementation guidance**  
PII transfer between jurisdictions can be subject to legal requirements depending on the jurisdiction or organization to which PII is to be transferred (and from where it originates). The organization should document compliance with such requirements as the basis for transfer.

The organization should inform the customer of any transfer of PII, including transfers to:
- suppliers;
- other parties;
- other countries or international organizations.

In case of changes, the organization should inform the customer in advance, according to an agreed time frame, so that the customer has the ability to object to such changes or to terminate the contract.

The agreement between the organization and the customer can include clauses where the organization can implement changes without informing the customer. In these cases, the limits of this allowance should be set (e.g. the organization can change suppliers without informing the customer but cannot transfer PII to other countries).

In case of international transfer of PII, agreements such as model contract clauses, binding corporate rules or cross border privacy rules, the countries involved and the circumstances in which such agreements apply, should be identified.

##### B.2.5.3 Countries and international organizations to which PII can be transferred
**Control**  
The organization should specify and document the countries and international organizations to which PII can possibly be transferred.

**Implementation guidance**  
The identities of the countries and international organizations to which PII can possibly be transferred in normal operations should be made available to customers. The identities of the countries arising from the use of subcontracted PII processing should be included. The countries included should be considered in relation to B.2.5.2.

Outside of normal operations, there can be cases of transfer made at the request of a legal authority, for which the identity of the countries cannot be specified in advance, or such transfer can be prohibited by applicable jurisdictions to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation (see B.1.5.2, B.2.5.5 and B.2.5.6).

##### B.2.5.4 Records of PII disclosures to third parties
**Control**  
The organization should record disclosures of PII to third parties, including which PII has been disclosed, to whom and when.

**Implementation guidance**  
PII can be disclosed during normal operations. These disclosures should be recorded. Any additional disclosures to third parties, such as those arising from legal investigations or external audits, should also be recorded. The records should include the source of the disclosure and the source of the authority to make the disclosure.

##### B.2.5.5 Notification of PII disclosure requests
**Control**  
The organization should notify the customer of any legally binding requests for the disclosure of PII.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization can receive legally binding requests for the disclosure of PII (e.g. from legal authorities). In these cases, the organization should notify the customer of any such request within agreed time frames and according to an agreed procedure which can be included in the customer contract.

In some cases, the legally binding requests include the requirement for the organization not to notify anyone about the event. An example of a possible prohibition on disclosure would be a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a legal investigation.

##### B.2.5.6 Legally binding PII disclosures
**Control**  
The organization should reject any requests for PII disclosures that are not legally binding, consult the corresponding customer before making any PII disclosures and accept any contractually agreed requests for PII disclosures that are authorized by the corresponding customer.

**Implementation guidance**  
Details relevant to the implementation of the control can be included in the customer contract.

Such requests can originate from several sources, including courts, tribunals and administrative authorities. They can arise from any jurisdiction.

##### B.2.5.7 Disclosure of subcontractors used to process PII
**Control**  
Before use, the organization should disclose whether any subcontractors are used to process PII to the customer.

**Implementation guidance**  
Provisions for the use of subcontractors to process PII should be included in the customer contract. Information disclosed should cover the fact that subcontracting is used and the names of relevant subcontractors. The information disclosed should also include the countries and international organizations to which subcontractors can transfer data (see B.2.5.3) and the means by which subcontractors are obliged to meet or exceed the obligations of the organization (see B.2.5.8).

Where public disclosure of subcontractor information is assessed to increase security risk beyond acceptable limits, disclosure should be made under a non-disclosure agreement or on the request of the customer. The customer should be made aware that the information is available.

This does not concern the list of countries where the PII can be transferred. This list should be disclosed to the customer in all cases in a way that allows them to inform the appropriate PII principals.

##### B.2.5.8 Engagement of a subcontractor to process PII
**Control**  
The organization should only engage a subcontractor to process PII according to the customer contract.

**Implementation guidance**  
Where the organization subcontracts some or all of the processing of that PII to another organization, a written authorization from the customer is required prior to the PII processed by the subcontractor. This can be in the form of appropriate clauses in the customer contract or can be a specific "one-off" agreement.

The organization should have a written contract with any subcontractors that it uses for PII processing on its behalf. The organization should ensure that its contracts with subcontractors address the implementation of the appropriate controls in Table A.2.

The contract between the organization and any subcontractor processing PII on its behalf should require the subcontractor to implement the appropriate controls specified in Table A.2, taking account of the information security risk assessment process (see 6.1.2) and the scope of the processing of PII performed by the PII processor. By default, all controls specified in Table A.2 should be assumed as relevant. If the organization decides to not require the subcontractor to implement a control from Table A.2, it should justify its exclusion.

A contract can define the responsibilities of each party differently but, to be consistent with this document, all controls should be considered and included in the documented information.

##### B.2.5.9 Change of subcontractor to process PII
**Control**  
The organization should, in the case of having general written authorization, inform the customer of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of subcontractors to process PII, thereby giving the customer the opportunity to object to such changes.

**Implementation guidance**  
Where the organization changes the organization with which it subcontracts some or all of the processing of PII, then written authorization from the customer is required for the change, prior to the PII processed by the new subcontractor. This can be in the form of appropriate clauses in the customer contract or a specific "one-off" agreement.

### B.3 Implementation guidance for PII controllers and PII processors

#### B.3.1 Objective
To ensure the security of PII processing.

#### B.3.2 General
This clause provides PIMS guidance for PII controllers and PII processors, which relates to the controls listed in Table A.3. Unless otherwise stated by the specific provisions in Table A.3, or determined by the organization, the same guidance applies for PII controllers and PII processors.

#### B.3.3 Policies for information security
**Control**  
Information security policies related to PII processing should be defined, approved by management, published, communicated to and acknowledged by relevant personnel and relevant interested parties, and reviewed at planned intervals and if significant changes occur.

**Implementation guidance**  
Either by the development of separate privacy policies, or by the augmentation of information security policies, the organization should produce a statement concerning support for and commitment to achieving compliance with legal requirements applicable to PII protection and with the contractual terms agreed between the organization and its partners, its subcontractors and its applicable third parties (customers, suppliers etc.), which should clearly allocate responsibilities between them.

Any organization that processes PII, whether a PII controller or a PII processor, should consider legal requirements applicable to PII protection during the development and maintenance of information security policies.

#### B.3.4 Information security roles and responsibilities
**Control**  
Information security roles and responsibilities related to PII processing should be defined and allocated according to the organizational needs.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should designate a point of contact for use by the customer regarding the processing of PII.

When the organization is a PII controller, a point of contact should be designated for PII principals regarding the processing of their PII (see B.1.3.4).

The organization should appoint one or more persons responsible for developing, implementing, maintaining and monitoring an organization-wide governance and privacy programme, to ensure compliance with all applicable legal requirements regarding the processing of PII.

The responsible person should, where appropriate:
- be independent and report directly to the appropriate management level of the organization in order to ensure effective management of privacy risks;
- be involved in the management of all issues which relate to the processing of PII;
- be an expert in data protection legislation, regulation and practice;
- act as a contact point for supervisory authorities;
- inform top-level management and employees of the organization of their obligations with respect to the processing of PII;
- provide advice in respect of privacy impact assessments conducted by the organization.

> **NOTE:** Some jurisdictions refer to this person as a data protection officer. Jurisdictions define when such a position is required, along with their position and role. This position can be fulfilled by a staff member or outsourced.

#### B.3.5 Classification of information
**Control**  
Information should be classified according to the information security needs of the organization, taking into consideration PII, based on confidentiality, integrity, availability and relevant interested party requirements.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization's information classification scheme should explicitly consider PII as part of the scheme it implements. Considering PII within the overall classification scheme is integral to understanding which PII the organization processes (e.g. type, special categories), where such PII is stored and the systems through which it can flow.

#### B.3.6 Labelling of information
**Control**  
An appropriate set of procedures for information labelling that considers PII should be developed and implemented in accordance with the information classification scheme adopted by the organization.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should ensure that people under its control are made aware of the definition of PII and how to recognize information that is PII.

#### B.3.7 Information transfer
**Control**  
Information transfer rules, procedures, or agreements related to processing PII should be in place for all types of transfer facilities within the organization and between the organization and other parties.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should consider procedures for ensuring that rules related to the processing of PII are enforced throughout and outside of the system, where applicable.

#### B.3.8 Identity management
**Control**  
The full life cycle of identities related to PII processing should be managed.

**Implementation guidance**  
Procedures for registration and de-registration of users who administer or operate systems and services that process PII should address the situation where user access control for those users is compromised, such as the corruption or compromise of passwords or other user registration data (e.g. as a result of inadvertent disclosure).

The organization should not reissue to users any de-activated or expired user IDs for systems and services that process PII.

In the case where the organization is providing PII processing as a service, the customer can be responsible for some or all aspects of user ID management. Such cases should be included in the documented information.

Some jurisdictions impose specific requirements regarding the frequency of checks for unused authentication credentials related to systems that process PII. Organizations operating in these jurisdictions should take compliance with these requirements into account.

#### B.3.9 Access rights
**Control**  
Access rights to PII and other associated assets related to PII processing should be provisioned, reviewed, modified and removed in accordance with the organization's topic-specific policy on and rules for access control.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should maintain an accurate, up-to-date record of the user profiles created for users who have authorized access to the information system and the PII contained therein. Each profile comprises the set of data about the user, including user ID, necessary to implement the identified technical controls providing authorized access.

Implementing individual user access IDs enables appropriately configured systems to identify who accessed PII and what additions, deletions or changes they made. As well as protecting the organization, users are also protected as they can identify what they have processed and what they have not processed.

In the case where the organization is providing PII processing as a service, the customer can be responsible for some or all aspects of access management. Where appropriate, the organization should provide the customer with the means to perform access management, such as by providing administrative rights to manage or terminate access. Such cases should be included in the documented information.

#### B.3.10 Addressing information security within supplier agreements
**Control**  
Relevant information security requirements related to PII processing should be established and agreed with each supplier based on the type of supplier relationship.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should specify in agreements with suppliers whether PII is processed and the minimum technical and organizational measures that the supplier is required to meet for the organization to meet its information security and PII protection obligations (see B.1.2.7 and B.2.2.2).

Supplier agreements should clearly allocate responsibilities between the organization, its partners, its suppliers and its relevant third parties (customers, suppliers, etc.) taking into account the type of PII processed.

The agreements between the organization and its suppliers should provide a mechanism for ensuring the organization supports and manages compliance with all applicable legal requirements. The agreements should call for independently audited compliance, acceptable to the customer.

> **NOTE:** For such audit purposes, compliance with relevant and applicable security standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 can be considered.

Where the role of the organization is a PII processor, the organization should specify in contracts with any suppliers that PII is only processed according to its instructions.

#### B.3.11 Information security incident management planning and preparation
**Control**  
The organization should plan and prepare for managing information security incidents related to PII processing by defining, establishing and communicating incident management processes, roles and responsibilities.

**Implementation guidance**  
As part of the overall information security incident management process, the organization should establish responsibilities and procedures for identifying and recording breaches of PII. Additionally, the organization should establish responsibilities and procedures related to notifying relevant parties of PII breaches (including the timing of such notifications) and the disclosure to authorities, taking into account the applicable legal requirements.

Some jurisdictions impose specific regulations regarding breach responses, including notification. Organizations operating in these jurisdictions should ensure that they are aware of, and document how they comply with, these regulations.

#### B.3.12 Response to information security incidents
**Control**  
Responses to information security incidents related to PII processing should be according to the documented procedures.

**Implementation guidance for PII controllers**  
An incident that involves PII should trigger a review by the organization, as part of its information security incident management process, to determine if a breach involving PII that requires a response has taken place. An event does not necessarily trigger such a review.

> **NOTE 1:** An information security event does not necessarily result in actual, or the significant probability of, unauthorized access to PII or to any of the organization's equipment or facilities storing PII. These can include, but are not limited to, pings and other broadcast attacks on firewalls or edge servers, port scans, unsuccessful log-on attempts, denial of service attacks and packet sniffing.

When a breach of PII has occurred, response procedures should include relevant notifications and records. Some jurisdictions define cases when the breach should be notified to the relevant supervisory authority and when it should be notified to PII principals.

Notifications should be clear.

> **NOTE 2:** A notification can contain details such as:
> - a contact point where more information can be obtained;
> - a description of and the likely consequences of the breach;
> - a description of the breach including the number of individuals concerned as well as the number of records concerned;
> - measures taken or planned to be taken.  
> **NOTE 3:** Information on the management of security incidents can be found in the ISO/IEC 27035 series.

Where a breach involving PII has occurred, a record should be maintained with sufficient information to provide a report for regulatory or forensic purposes, such as:
- a description of the incident;
- the time period;
- the consequences of the incident;
- the name of the reporter;
- to whom the incident was reported;
- the steps taken to resolve the incident (including the person in charge and the data recovered);
- the fact that the incident resulted in unavailability, loss, disclosure or alteration of PII.

In the event that a breach involving PII has occurred, the record should also include a description of the PII compromised, if known. If notifications were used, the steps taken to notify PII principals, regulatory agencies or customers should also be recorded.

**Implementation guidance for PII processors**  
Provisions covering the notification of a breach involving PII should form part of the contract between the organization and the customer. The contract should specify how the organization will provide the information necessary for the customer to fulfil their obligation to notify relevant authorities. This notification obligation does not extend to a breach caused by the customer or PII principal, or within system components for which they are responsible. The contract should also define expected and externally mandated limits for notification response times.

In some jurisdictions, the PII processor should notify the PII controller of the existence of a breach without undue delay (i.e. as soon as it is discovered), so that the PII controller can take the appropriate actions.

Where a breach involving PII has occurred, a record should be maintained with sufficient information to provide a report for regulatory or forensic purposes, such as:
- a description of the incident;
- the time period;
- the consequences of the incident;
- the name of the reporter;
- to whom the incident was reported;
- the steps taken to resolve the incident (including the person in charge and the data recovered);
- the fact that the incident resulted in unavailability, loss, disclosure or alteration of PII.

In the event that a breach involving PII has occurred, the record should also include a description of the PII compromised, if known; and if notifications were used, the steps taken to notify the customer or the regulatory agencies.

In some jurisdictions, applicable legal requirements can require the organization to directly notify appropriate regulatory authorities (e.g. a PII protection authority) of a breach involving PII.

#### B.3.13 Legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements
**Control**  
Legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements relevant to information security related to PII processing and the organization's approach to meet these requirements should be documented and this documentation kept up to date.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should identify any potential legal sanctions (which can result from some obligations being missed) related to the processing of PII, including substantial fines directly from the local supervisory authority.

In some jurisdictions, International Standards such as this document can be used to form the basis for a contract between the organization and the customer, outlining their respective security, privacy and PII protection responsibilities. The terms of the contract can provide a basis for contractual sanctions in the event of a breach of those responsibilities.

#### B.3.14 Protection of records
**Control**  
Records related to PII processing should be protected from loss, destruction, falsification, unauthorized access and unauthorized release.

**Implementation guidance**  
Review of current and historical policies and procedures can be required (e.g. in the cases of customer dispute resolution and investigation by a supervisory authority).

The organization should retain copies of its privacy policies and associated procedures for a period as specified in its retention schedule (see B.1.4.8). This includes retention of previous versions of these documents when they are updated.

#### B.3.15 Independent review of information security
**Control**  
The organization's approach to managing information security related to PII processing and its implementation including people, processes and technologies, should be reviewed independently at planned intervals, or when significant changes occur.

**Implementation guidance**  
Where an organization is acting as a PII processor, and where individual customer audits are impractical or can increase risks to security, the organization should make available to customers, prior to entering into and for the duration of a contract, independent evidence that information security is implemented and operated in accordance with the organization's policies and procedures. A relevant independent audit, as selected by the organization, should normally be an acceptable method for fulfilling the customer's interest in reviewing the organization's processing operations, if it covers the needs of anticipated users and if results are provided in a sufficiently transparent manner.

#### B.3.16 Compliance with policies, rules and standards for information security
**Control**  
Compliance with the organization's information security policy, topic-specific policies, rules and standards related to PII processing should be regularly reviewed.

**Implementation guidance**  
As part of technical reviews of compliance with security policies and standards, the organization should include methods of reviewing tools and components related to processing PII. This can include:
- ongoing monitoring to verify that only permitted processing is taking place; or
- specific penetration or vulnerability tests (e.g. de-identified data sets can be subject to a motivated intruder test to validate that de-identification methods are compliant with organizational requirements).

#### B.3.17 Information security awareness, education and training
**Control**  
Personnel of the organization and relevant interested parties should receive appropriate information security awareness education and training and regular updates of the organization's information security policy, topic-specific policies and procedures, as relevant for their job function, as they relate to PII processing.

**Implementation guidance**  
Measures should be put in place, including raising awareness of incident reporting, to ensure that relevant staff are aware of the possible consequences of breaching privacy or security rules and procedures, especially those addressing the handling of PII. These include consequences for the organization (e.g. legal consequences, loss of business and brand or reputational damage), to the staff member (e.g. disciplinary consequences) and to the PII principal (e.g. physical, material and emotional consequences) of breaching privacy or security rules and procedures, especially those addressing the handling of PII.

> **NOTE:** Such measures can include the use of appropriate periodic training for personnel having access to PII.

#### B.3.18 Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements
**Control**  
Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements reflecting the organization's needs for the protection of PII should be identified, documented, regularly reviewed and signed by personnel and other relevant interested parties.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should ensure that individuals operating under its control with access to PII are subject to a confidentiality obligation. The confidentiality agreement, whether part of a contract or separate, should specify the length of time the obligations should be adhered to.

When the organization is a PII processor, a confidentiality agreement, in whatever form, between the organization, its employees and its agents should ensure that employees and agents comply with the policy and procedures concerning data handling and protection.

#### B.3.19 Clear desk and clear screen
**Control**  
Clear desk rules for papers and removable storage media and clear screen rules for information processing facilities should be defined and appropriately enforced.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should restrict the creation of hardcopy material including PII to the minimum needed to fulfil the identified processing purpose.

#### B.3.20 Storage media
**Control**  
Storage media with PII should be managed through its life cycle of acquisition, use, transportation and disposal in accordance with the organization's classification scheme and handling requirements.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should document any use of removable media or devices for the storage of PII. Wherever feasible, the organization should use removable physical media or devices that permit encryption when storing PII. Unencrypted media should only be used where unavoidable, and in instances where unencrypted media or devices are used, the organization should implement procedures and compensating controls (e.g. tamper-evident packaging) to mitigate risks to the PII.

Where removable media on which PII is stored is disposed of, secure disposal procedures should be included in the documented information and implemented to ensure that previously stored PII will not be accessible.

If physical media is used for information transfer, a system should be put in place to record incoming and outgoing physical media containing PII, including the type of physical media, the authorized sender, the authorized recipients, the date and time, and the number of physical media. Where possible, additional measures such as encryption should be implemented to ensure that the data can only be accessed at the point of destination and not in transit.

The organization should subject physical media containing PII before leaving its premises to an authorization procedure and ensure the PII is not accessible to anyone other than authorized personnel.

> **NOTE:** One possible measure to ensure PII on physical media leaving the organization's premises is not generally accessible is to encrypt the PII concerned and restrict decryption capabilities to authorized personnel.

Removable media which is taken outside the physical confines of the organization is prone to loss, damage and inappropriate access. Encrypting removable media adds a level of protection for PII, which reduces security and privacy risks if the removable media is compromised.

#### B.3.21 Secure disposal or re-use of equipment
**Control**  
Items of equipment containing storage media with PII should be verified to ensure that any sensitive data and licensed software has been removed or securely overwritten prior to disposal or re-use.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should ensure that, whenever storage space is re-assigned, any PII previously residing on that storage space is not accessible.

With regard to deletion of PII held in an information system, performance issues can mean that explicit erasure of that PII is impractical. This creates the risk that another user can access the PII. Such risk should be avoided by specific technical measures.

For secure disposal or re-use, equipment containing storage media that can possibly contain PII should be treated as though it contains PII.

#### B.3.22 User endpoint devices
**Control**  
PII stored on, processed by or accessible via user endpoint devices should be protected.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should ensure that the use of mobile devices does not lead to a compromise of PII.

#### B.3.23 Secure authentication
**Control**  
Secure authentication technologies and procedures related to PII processing should be implemented based on information access restrictions.

**Implementation guidance**  
Where required by the customer, the organization should provide the capability for secure log-on procedures for any user accounts under the customer's control.

#### B.3.24 Information backup
**Control**  
Backup copies of PII, and software and systems related to PII processing should be maintained and regularly tested.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should have a policy which addresses the requirements for backup, recovery and restoration of PII (which can be part of an overall information backup policy) and any further requirements (e.g. contractual or legal requirements) for the erasure of PII contained in information held for backup requirements.

PII-specific responsibilities in this respect can depend on the customer. The organization should ensure that the customer has been informed of the limits of the service regarding backup.

Where the organization explicitly provides backup and restore services to customers, the organization should provide them with clear information about their capabilities with respect to backup and restoration of PII.

Some jurisdictions impose specific requirements regarding the frequency of backups of PII, the frequency of reviews and tests of backup, or regarding the recovery procedures for PII. Organizations operating in these jurisdictions should demonstrate compliance with these requirements.

There can be occasions where PII is required to be restored, perhaps due to a system malfunction, attack or disaster. When PII is restored (typically from backup media), processes should be in place to ensure that the PII is restored into a state where the integrity of PII can be assured, or where PII inaccuracy or incompleteness is identified and processes put in place to resolve them (which can involve the PII principal).

The organization should have a procedure for, and a log of, PII restoration efforts. At a minimum, the log of the PII restoration efforts should contain:
- the name of the person responsible for the restoration;
- a description of the restored PII.

Some jurisdictions prescribe the content of the logs of PII restoration efforts. Organizations should be able to document compliance with any such requirements for restoration log content. The conclusions of such deliberations should be included in the documented information.

The use of subcontractors to store replicated or backup copies of PII processed is covered by the controls in this document applying to subcontracted PII processing (see B.3.10, B.3.20). Where physical media transfers take place related to backups and restoration, this is also covered by controls in this document (see B.3.7).

#### B.3.25 Logging
**Control**  
Logs that record activities, exceptions, faults and other relevant events related to PII processing should be produced, stored, protected and analysed.

**Implementation guidance**  
A process should be put in place to review event logs using continuous, automated monitoring and alerting processes, or else manually where such a review should be performed with a specified, documented periodicity, to identify irregularities and propose remediation efforts.

Where possible, event logs should record access to PII, including by whom, when, which PII principal's PII was accessed, and what (if any) changes were made (e.g. additions, modifications or deletions) as a result of the event.

Where multiple service providers are involved in providing services, there can be varied or shared roles in implementing this guidance. These roles should be clearly defined and included in the documented information, and agreement on any log access between providers should be addressed.

Log information recorded for, for example, security monitoring and operational diagnostics, can contain PII. Measures such as controlling access should be put in place to ensure that logged information is only used as intended.

A procedure, preferably automatic, should be put in place to ensure that logged information is either deleted or de-identified as specified in the retention schedule (see B.1.4.8).

**Implementation guidance for PII processors**  
The organization should define criteria regarding if, when and how log information can be made available to or usable by the customer. These criteria should be made available to the customer.

Where the organization permits its customers to access log records controlled by the organization, the organization should implement appropriate controls to ensure that the customer:
- can only access records that relate to that customer's activities;
- cannot access any log records which relate to the activities of other customers; and
- cannot amend the logs in any way.

#### B.3.26 Use of cryptography
**Control**  
Rules for the effective use of cryptography related to PII processing, including cryptographic key management, should be defined and implemented.

**Implementation guidance**  
Some jurisdictions can require the use of cryptography to protect particular kinds of PII, such as health data, resident registration numbers, passport numbers and driver's licence numbers.

The organization should provide information to the customer regarding the circumstances in which it uses cryptography to protect the PII it processes. The organization should also provide information to the customer about any capabilities it provides that can assist the customer in applying their own cryptographic protection.

#### B.3.27 Secure development life cycle
**Control**  
Rules for the secure development of software and systems related to PII processing should be established and applied.

**Implementation guidance**  
Policies for system development and design should include guidance for the organization's processing of PII needs, based on obligations to PII principals or any applicable legal requirements and the types of processing performed by the organization.

Policies that contribute to privacy by design and privacy by default should consider the following aspects:
- **a)** guidance on PII protection and the implementation of the privacy principles (see ISO/IEC 29100) in the software development life cycle;
- **b)** privacy and PII protection requirements in the design phase, which can be based on the output from a privacy risk assessment or a privacy impact assessment (see B.1.2.6);
- **c)** PII protection checkpoints within project milestones;
- **d)** required privacy and PII protection knowledge;
- **e)** by default, minimize processing of PII.

#### B.3.28 Application security requirements
**Control**  
Information security requirements related to PII processing should be identified, specified and approved when developing or acquiring applications.

**Implementation guidance**  
The organization should ensure that PII that is transmitted over untrusted data transmission networks is encrypted for transmission.

Untrusted networks can include the public internet and other facilities outside of the operational control of the organization.

> **NOTE:** In some cases (e.g. the exchange of email), the inherent characteristics of untrusted data transmission network systems can require that some header or traffic data be exposed for effective transmission.

#### B.3.29 Secure system architecture and engineering principles
**Control**  
Principles for engineering secure systems related to processing PII should be established, documented, maintained and applied to any information system development activities.

**Implementation guidance**  
Systems or components related to the processing of PII should be designed following the principles of privacy by design and privacy by default, and to anticipate and facilitate the implementation of relevant controls (as described in B.1 and B.2 for PII controllers and PII processors, respectively), in particular such that the collection and processing of PII in those systems is limited to what is necessary for the identified purposes of the processing of PII (see B.1.2.2).

For example, an organization that processes PII should ensure that it disposes of PII after a specified period. The system that processes that PII should be designed in a way to facilitate this deletion requirement.

> **NOTE:** Legal requirements can apply.

#### B.3.30 Outsourced development
**Control**  
The organization should direct, monitor and review the activities related to outsourced PII processing system development.

**Implementation guidance**  
The same principles (see B.3.29) of privacy by design and privacy by default should be applied, if applicable, to outsourced information systems.

#### B.3.31 Test information
**Control**  
Test information related to PII processing should be appropriately selected, protected and managed.

**Implementation guidance**  
PII should not be used for testing purposes; false or synthetic PII should be used. Where the use of PII for testing purposes cannot be avoided, technical and organizational measures equivalent to those used in the production environment should be implemented to minimize the risks. Where such equivalent measures are not feasible, a risk assessment should be undertaken and used to identify the selection of appropriate mitigating controls.
